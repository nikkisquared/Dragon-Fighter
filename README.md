History
=======
Dragon Fighter RPG was my first original game after having learned python over the summer of 2011. The first version I made in about two months, starting in June 2011. I designed it around CYOA logic, in that you are given limited options leading to unpredictable results. A year later, June 2012 I set myself to remake it as a more nuanced game, with a meaningful combat options menu that, to test my improved skills in programming. This only took me a single day! Some time after that, likely late 2012 though I cannot find out dates on this, I re-made a better version yet again, by planning out the internal logic on paper. It ended up being about 100 lines shorter, while having more features! I've now dusted off that third version, made the code hopefully more readable, and left all of the (sometimes bizarre) code structures intact as a sort of preservation of how I approached programming at the time.
